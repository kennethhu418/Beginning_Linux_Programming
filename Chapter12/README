This project simulates Producer-Consumer Problem:
Suppose there are N cores on the system, then there will be N queues in the simulation, where on each core there will be one queue.

On each core, we allocate P producer threads (specified by -p switch) and C consumer threads (specified by -c switch), and they push and pop items to the queue on this core.

The threads on the first core will have real time schedule policy and the threads on other cores will have normal schedule policy.
