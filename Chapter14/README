In this Chapter's practice, we still use the Producer/Consumer Model.
Different with Chapter12, here each producer and a consumer is implemented as a process. On each core, there is only one consumer and one consumer.

Please run the "RunSim.sh" under each implementation folder to run the simulation.

Two implementations:
1) Producer and Consumer share memory, where the queue on this core is stored.

2) Producer and Consumer communicates through the message queue.
   Producer sends the produced item to the message queue and the Consumer retrieves the item from the message queue.
